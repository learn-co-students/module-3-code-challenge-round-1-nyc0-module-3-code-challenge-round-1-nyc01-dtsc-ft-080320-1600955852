## Calculus, Cost Function, and Gradient Descent [Suggested Time: 25 min]
---

![best fit line](visuals/best_fit_line.png)

The best fit line that goes through the scatterplot up above can be generalized in the following equation: $$y = mx + b$$

Of all the possible lines, we can prove why that particular line was chosen using the plot down below:

![](visuals/cost_curve.png)

where RSS is defined as the residual sum of squares:

$$ 
\begin{align}
RSS &= \sum_{i=1}^n(actual - expected)^2 \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat{y})^2 \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - (mx_i + b))^2
\end{align}
$$ 

### 1. What is a more generalized name for the RSS curve above? How is it related to machine learning models?


```python
# Your answer here

### 2. Would you rather choose a $m$ value of 0.08 or 0.05 from the RSS curve up above?   What is the relation between the position on the cost curve, the error, and the slope of the line?


```python
# Your answer here
```

## Decision Trees [Suggested Time: 15 min]

### Concepts 
You're given a dataset of **30** elements, 15 of which belong to a positive class (denoted by *`+`* ) and 15 of which do not (denoted by `-`). These elements are described by two attributes, A and B, that can each have either one of two values, true or false. 

The diagrams below show the result of splitting the dataset by attribute: the diagram on the left hand side shows that if we split by Attribute A there are 13 items of the positive class and 2 of the negative class in one branch and 2 of the positive and 13 of the negative in the other branch. The right hand side shows that if we split the data by Attribute B there are 8 items of the positive class and 7 of the negative class in one branch and 7 of the positive and 8 of the negative in the other branch.

<img src="visuals/decision_stump.png">

**1.1) Which one of the two attributes resulted in the best split of the original data? How do you select the best attribute to split a tree at each node?** _(Hint: Mention splitting criteria)_


```python
# Your answer here 
```

### Decision Trees for Regression 

In this section, you will use decision trees to fit a regression model to the Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset. 

This dataset is from the UCI ML Dataset Repository, and has been included in the `data` folder of this repository as an Excel `.xlsx` file, `Folds5x2_pp.xlsx`. 

The features of this dataset consist of hourly average ambient variables taken from various sensors located around a power plant that record the ambient variables every second.  
- Temperature (AT) 
- Ambient Pressure (AP) 
- Relative Humidity (RH)
- Exhaust Vacuum (V) 

The target to predict is the net hourly electrical energy output (PE). 

The features and target variables are not normalized.

In the cells below, we import `pandas` and `numpy` for you, and we load the data into a pandas DataFrame. We also include code to inspect the first five rows and get the shape of the DataFrame.


```python
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 

# Load the data
filename = 'raw_data/Folds5x2_pp.xlsx'
df = pd.read_excel(filename)
```


```python
# Inspect the first five rows of the dataframe
df.head()
```

```python
# Get the shape of the dataframe 
df.shape
```

Before fitting any models, you need to create training and testing splits for the data.

Below, we split the data into features and target ('PE') for you. 


```python
X = df[df.columns.difference(['PE'])]
y = df['PE']
```

**1.2) Split the data into training and test sets. Create training and test sets with `test_size=0.5` and `random_state=1`.** 


```python
# Your code here. Replace None with appropriate code. 

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = None
```

**1.3) Fit a vanilla decision tree regression model with scikit-learn to the training data.** Set `random_state = 1` for reproducibility. **Evaluate the model on the test data.** 


```python
# Your code here 
```

**1.4) Obtain the mean squared error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination (r2 score) of the predictions on the test set.** _Hint: Look at the `sklearn.metrics` module._


```python
# Your code here. Replace None with appropriate code. 

print("Mean Squared Error:", None)
print("Mean Absolute Error:", None)
print("R-squared:", None)
```

Hint: MSE = 22.21041691053512

### Hyperparameter Tuning of Decision Trees for Regression

For this next section feel free to refer to the scikit learn documentation on [decision tree regressors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html)

**1.5) Add hyperparameters to a a new decision tree and fit it to our training data and evaluate the model with the test data.**


```python
# Your code here 
```

**1.6) Obtain the mean squared error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination (r2 score) of the predictions on the test set. Did this improve your previous model? (It's ok if it didn't)**

# Your answer and explanation here
```

## Ensemble Methods [Suggested Time: 15 min]

### Random Forests and Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV

In this section, you will perform hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest classifier using GridSearchCV. You will use `scikit-learn`'s wine dataset to classify wines into one of three different classes. 

After finding the best estimator, you will interpret the best model's feature importances. 

In the cells below, we have loaded the relevant imports and the wine data for you. 


```python
# Relevant imports 
from sklearn.datasets import load_wine

# Load the data 
wine = load_wine()
X, y = load_wine(return_X_y=True)
X = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=wine.feature_names)
y = pd.Series(y)
y.name = 'target'
df = pd.concat([X, y.to_frame()], axis=1)
```

In the cells below, we inspect the first five rows of the dataframe and compute the dataframe's shape.


```python
df.head()
```


```python
df.shape
```

We also get descriptive statistics for the dataset features, and obtain the distribution of classes in the dataset. 


```python
X.describe()
```


```python
y.value_counts().sort_index()
```

You will now perform hyper-parameter tuning for a Random Forest classifier.

**4.1) Construct a `param_grid` dictionary to pass to `GridSearchCV` when instantiating the object. Choose at least 3 hyper-parameters to tune and 3 values for each.** 


```python
# Replace None with relevant code 
param_grid = None
```

Now that you have created the `param_grid` dictionary of hyperparameters, let's continue performing hyperparameter optimization of a Random Forest Classifier. 

In the cell below, we include the relevant imports for you.


```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
```

**4.2) Create an instance of a Random Forest classifier estimator; call it `rfc`.** Make sure to set `random_state=42` for reproducibility. 


```python
# Replace None with appropriate code
rfc = None
```

**4.3) Create an instance of an `GridSearchCV` object and fit it to the data.** Call the instance `cv_rfc`. 

* Use the random forest classification estimator you instantiated in the cell above, the parameter grid dictionary constructed, and make sure to perform 5-fold cross validation. 
* The fitting process should take 10 - 15 seconds to complete. 


```python
# Replace None with appropriate code 
cv_rfc = None 

cv_rfc.fit(None, None)
```

**4.4) What are the best training parameters found by GridSearchCV?** 

_Hint: Explore the documentation for GridSearchCV._ 


```python
# Replace None with appropriate code 
None 
```

In the cell below, we create a variable `best_model` that holds the best model found by the grid search.


```python
best_model = cv_rfc.best_estimator_
```

Next, we give you a function that creates a horizontal bar plot to visualize the feature importances of a model, sorted in descending order. 


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
%matplotlib inline 

def create_plot_of_feature_importances(model, X):
    ''' 
    Inputs: 
    
    model: A trained ensemble model instance
    X: a dataframe of the features used to train the model
    '''
    
    feat_importances = model.feature_importances_

    features_and_importances = zip(X.columns, feat_importances)
    features_and_importances = sorted(features_and_importances, 
                                     key = lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    features = [i[0] for i in features_and_importances]
    importances = [i[1] for i in features_and_importances]
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.barh(features, importances)
    plt.gca().invert_yaxis()
    plt.title('Feature Importances')
    plt.xlabel('importance')
```

**4.5) Create a plot of the best model's feature importances.** 

_Hint: To create the plot, pass the appropriate parameters to the function above._


```python
# Your code here.
```

**4.6) What are this model's top 3 features in order of descending importance?**


```python
# Your answer here 
```
